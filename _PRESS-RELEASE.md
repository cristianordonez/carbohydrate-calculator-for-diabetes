There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading

> Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
> App where you put in height, weight, age, gender, activity level, and it shows you how many carbohydrates you need per meal and per day and gives you a sample meal plan matching those carbohydrates

## Sub-Heading

> Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
> Marketed for patients with T2DM, gives them easy way to visualize what a typical day of eating should look like given their dx

## Summary

> Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
> A web application that takes in your weight, height, age, gender, activity level, then gives you how many carbohydrates you should eat and then provides you with sample meal plan.

## Problem

> Describe the problem your product solves.
> Helps solve the difficulty of finding sample days of eating that are Registered Dietitian approved for patients with T2DM

## Solution

> Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
> Automatically gives sample meal plan, and as a Registered Dietitian myself I can make sure it meets the guidelines a patient would need given their metrics

## Quote from You

> A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
> "When you have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, it can be overwhelming to find out how many carbohydrates you actually SHOULD be eating or what find of foods might actually not raise your blood sugar to a dangerous level. If you enter some basic information into this app, it will give you the exact number of carbohydrates you need to eat as well as a sample meal plan that fits your food preferences to make sure your BG levels stay at a normal range"

## How to Get Started

> Describe how easy it is to get started.
> Just enter height, weight, age, gender, and activity level to get started

## Customer Quote

> Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
> "Following this meal plan and carbohydrate count I was able to decrease my Ha1c from a 7.5% to a 6.5%"

## Closing and Call to Action

> Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
